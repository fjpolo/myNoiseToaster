# Noise Toaster

Digital version of Noise Toaster based on the book "Make: Analog Synthesizers. A modern Approach to Old-School DIY sound synthesis" by Ray Wilson. Using JUCE C++14 under MSV2019.-

## About the analog Noise Toaster

MFOS NOISE TOASTER Lo-Fi Noise Box: This is a fairly simple project and is perfect for a synth-diy newbie or a young person interested in synth-diy or making noise boxes. It is slightly more challenging than the Alien Screamer or Weird Sound Generator and would make a great second project unless you already have electronic project skills in which case it will be a piece of cake. This project results in a little LO-FI noise maker you'll find yourself playing with again and again. You will need to know how to: Read a schematic, Relate schematic diagrams to physical components, Solder, Populate a PC board, Wire the unit's front panel components together and to the PC board., Make a simple case or build the board into something unusual.

## About the digital Noise Toaster

Although it's based on the analog version from Ray Wilson, the digital world is not the same as the analog world. Physical modeling could be used to emulate the real deal, although not at the moment. The idea behind the digital version is to have the same modules as the analog, doing kind of the same thing, although the final result will vary, as using incomplete DSP techniques will result in artifacts in some of the resulting waves. Anyways, it's my tribute to this awesome little Lo-Fi synthesizer, but with my own personal touch.
